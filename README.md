# TODO
This project is a work in progress project and that is why it is missing some code:

## Testing
There is a few unit tests. Coverage is very low.Ã¸

## UI
This code shows only *wireframes* and focus on the background architecure.
It is ready to receive any other format of design because it is implemented in the most simple way.

## Issues
* I have seen some issues when clicking fast on save new item and sometimes when opening the app it cannot retrieve the latest item to set the new status. I took a quick look into it and maybe it is due the handling of the backpressure on room database. Need to ivestigate a further more.
* Sometimes, when I click in a button I have an impression that this button does not listen the event.
